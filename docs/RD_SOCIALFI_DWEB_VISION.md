# R&D Proposal: Budlum SocialFi & D-Web Integration (+)

**Author:** ARENA1 (Core/R&D)
**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Status:** Canonical / Active Development

## 1. Vision: "The Universal Consensus Layer"

Budlum is the **Universal Consensus Layer**—the next layer of the internet focused on data sovereignty and societal flourishing. It serves as a paradigm shift toward a decentralized, human-centric digital world.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Posts as NFTs:** Every social media interaction (post, image, video) is minted as a lightweight NFT on-chain.
2.  **B.U.D. Backend:** Content of these NFTs is stored across the B.U.D. network, ensuring data sovereignty.
3.  **BNS Profiles:** `.bud` names serve as the "Root URL" for user profiles and personal websites.
4.  **D-Web Resolution:** Browsers resolve `name.bud` to a B.U.D. `ManifestId` for fully owner-controlled websites.
5.  **User-to-AI Data Market:** Users "market" their data to AI agents, receiving instant P2P payments in $BUD.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 NFT-Storage Linkage
-   **Transaction Type:** `NftMint`, `NftTransfer`, `NftBurn`, `NftTag`, `NftUpdateLight`.
-   **Digital Bud (B05):** NFTs represent social posts. Transferring the NFT moves the content and its revenue stream (L02) to the new owner's profile.
-   **Luminance Algorithm (B04):**
    -   Initial state: 1.0 cd.
    -   Positive: +0.0006 cd (>30s view), +0.005 cd (5/5 spark).
    -   Negative: -0.0006 cd (<1s view), -0.003 cd (darken), 10% annual decay.
    -   Threshold: UI reflects changes only at 0.1 cd intervals.

### 2.2 BNS-to-Site Mapping
-   **Social/Web Binding:** `.bud` names point to B.U.D. `ManifestId`s.
-   **D-Web Gateway:** Users can render personal websites directly from B.U.D. data linked to their BNS name.
-   **Subdomains:** Parent-controlled subdomains.

### 2.4 LUM & DeArt (Vision)
-   **LUM DeFi (L00):** A hub for dApp incubation and investment.
-   **DeArt:** Decentralized art lifecycle management using DeSci-style peer review.
-   **NFT-Driven Feed:** The SocialFi application renders a user's feed based on the NFTs they currently hold. Transferring an NFT effectively "transfers" the social content, making posts tradable or movable across different wallets while maintaining the B.U.D. storage link.

### 2.3 Universal Ecosystem Interface (Budlum Hub)
-   **Unified Portal:** A master interface where all blockchain applications (dApps) can register on-chain.
-   **Universal Relayer:** Acts as a master translator, allowing Budlum wallets/HSMs to execute transactions on any external chain (EVM, Solana, etc.).

## 3. R&D Implementation Details

### Q3: AI Data Marketplace (User-to-AI Monetization)
-   **Mechanism:** Users provide data to Arena AI agents for training/analysis in exchange for instant $BUD payments. Access is governed by "Selective Encryption".

### Q4: Zero-Fee Inbound Bridge
-   **Entry Logic:** Inbound transfers from other chains have no $BUD fee. Fees are deducted from the arriving asset, ensuring new users can join seamlessly without initial $BUD holdings.
-   **Spam Protection:** Small Proof-of-Work (PoW) tasks required for free bridge transactions.

## 4. Proposed Roadmap (ARENA1-3 Coordination)

1.  **ARENA1 (Core):** Finalize `NftBurn` logic and Universal Relayer interface templates.
2.  **ARENA2 (ZK):** Optimize BudZKVM for high-frequency SocialFi interaction batching.
3.  **ARENA3 (Security):** Implement Multi-Sig/Multi-Device approval logic for "Master Key" operations.
