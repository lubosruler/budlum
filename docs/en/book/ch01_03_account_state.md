# Chapter 1.3: Account State and State Machine Architecture

Account state is the blockchain's memory. It records balances, nonces, validator information, and the Merkle structures that make the current state provable.

## 1. Data Structures: What Lives in Memory?

### Struct: `Account`

An account is similar to a bank account:

-   `balance` stores spendable value.
-   `nonce` orders outgoing transactions and prevents replay.
-   optional metadata can support staking or execution paths.

### Struct: `Validator`

A validator represents an actor that can participate in consensus. Its fields track stake, public keys, status, and evidence-related metadata. These values determine whether the validator can propose, vote, or be slashed.

### Struct: `AccountState`

`AccountState` is the global memory of the chain. It keeps accounts, validators, cached Merkle leaves, dirty-account tracking, and dynamic parameters.

Dirty tracking matters because a single account update should not force the node to recompute the entire state tree. Budlum hardening moved `state_root` calculation to an **Incremental Merkle Trie**:

1.  **Low latency:** only affected paths are updated, giving roughly $O(\log N)$ behavior.
2.  **Disk-friendly persistence:** changed accounts are written individually as `ACCT:{pubkey}`.
3.  **Merkle proofs:** light clients can verify account balances with a path and the root.

## 2. Composite Consensus State Root

The account trie is only one part of the canonical state commitment. `calculate_state_root` now wraps that account root in a versioned `ConsensusStateV2` commitment containing:

-   validator state and sorted unbonding entries,
-   `epoch_index`, `base_fee`, and `block_reward`,
-   bridge, message, settlement, and global-header summary roots,
-   an explicit governance-disabled marker.

This matters because two nodes must not report the same state root when account balances match but validator economics or settlement state differ.

## 3. Dynamic Parameters and Governance

Runtime parameters such as gas values, limits, and validator settings are part of the state model. Governance code exists for research, but Mainnet v1 configuration explicitly rejects `features.governance = true`. BudZKVM contract execution is also experimental and rejected by the Mainnet v1 profile.

## 4. Functions and Business Logic

### `validate_transaction` and `validate_transaction_with_context`

Validation checks balance, nonce, chain ID, transaction type rules, fee requirements, bytecode shape, and signature correctness. The context-aware version can validate against temporary state, which is essential when selecting multiple transactions for the same block.

### `apply_transaction`

Application mutates state only after validation. It debits the sender, credits the receiver, increments nonce, handles fees, and marks modified accounts as dirty.

The `get_or_create` detail is important: receiving funds can create a new account without requiring it to exist beforehand.

### BudZKVM Atomicity Rule

For contract calls, Budlum applies an all-or-nothing rule:

1.  The sender's fee balance and nonce are verified.
2.  Bytecode shape is checked.
3.  `ZkVmExecutor::execute_bytecode` decodes bytecode, runs the VM with a gas limit, produces a proof, and verifies the proof.
4.  Only if every step succeeds are the fee and nonce committed.

### `apply_block_checked` and legacy `apply_block`

Block-level application is deterministic. Critical execution paths use `apply_block_checked`, which returns `BudlumResult<()>` and carries structured `BudlumError` data. The legacy `apply_block` wrapper still returns `Result<(), String>` for compatibility. If any transaction fails, the whole block is rejected.

### `apply_slashing`

Slashing applies economic justice. A validator that signs conflicting data can be removed or penalized according to evidence verified by the chain.
