# Chapter 5.1: Persistent Storage

This chapter explains how data moves from memory to disk, how the current `sled` backend is organized, and why Budlum now hides storage behind a trait boundary.

## 1. Data Structures: What Is Sled?

Budlum currently uses **Sled**, an embedded NoSQL key-value database, instead of a traditional SQL server. The production-hardening path is trait-first: business logic depends on `BlockchainStorage`, while `Storage` is one backend implementation.

### Why Sled?

1.  **Embedded:** no external PostgreSQL-style installation is needed.
2.  **Fast:** optimized for modern disk workloads.
3.  **Thread-safe:** many threads can read and write safely.

### Struct: `Storage`

`Storage` wraps the Sled database handle. Cloning it is cheap because it copies the handle, not the entire database.

### Trait: `BlockchainStorage`

`BlockchainStorage` defines the storage contract used by chain logic: block reads/writes, canonical commits, domain commitments, consensus state, mempool persistence, and settlement batches. This makes a future RocksDB backend possible without rewriting consensus or execution code.

## 2. Schema Design

Sled has keys and values, not tables. Budlum uses prefixes to keep data organized:

| Data | Key Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block | `{Hash}` | Store block bodies by hash. |
| Height | `HEIGHT:{Number}` | Find a block hash by height. |
| Transaction | `TX_IDX:{Hash}` | Find the block height for a transaction. |
| Account | `ACCT:{PubKey}` | Store per-account balance and nonce. |
| Mempool | `MEMPOOL:{Hash}` | Persist pending transactions. |
| QC Blob | `QC_BLOB:{Height}` | Audit checkpoint signatures. |
| Finality Cert | `FINALITY_CERT:{Height}` | Store finalized checkpoint proof. |
| State Root | `STATE_ROOT:{Height}` | Record canonical state root. |
| Canonical Height | `CANONICAL_HEIGHT` | Track canonical chain height. |
| Last Block | `LAST` | Point to the current tip. |
| Schema Version | `SCHEMA_VERSION` | Track migration level. |
| Commit Marker | `IN_PROGRESS_HEIGHT` | Detect and roll back an interrupted canonical commit. |

Values are written with binary serialization for compactness and speed. Legacy JSON reads are still tolerated during migration so existing research databases can be opened.

## 3. Code Analysis

### Function: `commit_durable_batch`

The canonical chain path builds a `DurableCommitBatch`. It writes an `IN_PROGRESS_HEIGHT` marker and flushes it before applying the atomic Sled batch. The batch includes the block, height and transaction indexes, tip metadata, state root, optional finality certificate, global headers, bridge state, and changed accounts. The marker is removed inside the same batch.

`Storage::new` calls `recover_interrupted_commit`. If a previous process stopped after placing the marker, startup removes height-local indexes and restores the previous tip before continuing.

The older `commit_block` helper still exists for compatibility. New canonical chain changes should use `commit_durable_batch`.

### Function: `save_domain_commitment_batch`

Settlement commits use a dedicated atomic batch: the domain commitment and every updated domain height/hash are persisted together. This closes the crash window where a node could restart with a commitment on disk but an old `last_committed_height`.

### Per-Account Persistence

Instead of storing the entire state as one giant JSON blob, each account is stored independently under `ACCT:{PubKey}`. Updating one account writes only that account.

### Function: `load_chain`

At startup, Budlum reads the `LAST` pointer and walks backward through previous hashes until genesis, then reverses the list to rebuild the chain.

## 5. Metadata Consistency After Reorg

Reorgs update not only block bodies but also canonical metadata: height indexes, state roots, transaction indexes, finality certificates, QC blobs, and the `LAST` pointer.

## 6. Migrations and Snapshot Export

`Storage::new` runs migrations on startup and writes `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`. Snapshot export can dump Sled key-value pairs as JSON for backup and recovery workflows, while runtime storage paths prefer binary values.

## 7. Remaining Production Work

The durable batch is an important crash-consistency improvement, not a complete database design freeze. A production archive format still needs an explicit persisted `ConsensusStateV2` envelope for validator, unbonding, and economics metadata, migration tests across released schema versions, backup restore drills, and storage fault injection.
